## About

Use your left and right arrow keys to defend yourself against the never ending onlaught of cascading tiles!

**Extra technical information**

*This project was developed with the Java programming language using a Maven configuration. All graphical user interface (GUI) components are drawn using
the native swing libraries. This codebase is best interacted with using the NetBeans IDE, as this is the development environment that has been used to
create the project, and contains proprietary code snippets.*
